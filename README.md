# PLURALSNUG!!!!!

A silly little thingy that we may actually finish maybe hopefully no promises.

## Okay so what actually is it thoguhg

> basically imagine if you had an app that could pk;export and then import to another bot/site

Your system information is stored in a directory on your computer (named a database). You can use Pluralsnug to sync the
data in this database to as many different platforms as you like (as long as they're supported). This can make keeping
your information up to date less of a hassle, and allows you to store it however you want to, whether it be Google cloud
or <span title="Yes, Windows reserves drive letters A and B for floppy drives by default">your century old floppy disk 
on drive letter A</span>
